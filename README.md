# League of Legends<a name='league'></a>
The league commands can be view via the **\/league help** command. The supported regions are na, br, eune, euw, jp, kr, lan, las, oce, tr, and ru.
## League Playercards<a name='lcard'></a>
Playercards can be created using the following command:
>\/league \<reigion\> player \<summoner\>

Where region is the corresponsing region (NA by default, see the league help menu for others)

A custom quote can be added to the card after verifying via the 'code' and 'verify' commands. Please see the league help menu for more details.

Here's a sample playercard the the bot generated:

![example playercard](leaguePlayercard.png)

## In-game cards <a name="lingame"></a>
You can pull up an image showing the teams of the current match for the specified summoner. Reacts will be added, and each one corresponds to a player from that match. Clicking a react will generate the playercard for the corresponding player:
>\/league \<reigion\> match \<summoner\>

Here's an example of what this looks like:
